# MJ-simple-island
 A simple island map generator configuration for MarkovJunior.

## How to use

* Download and install: https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior
* Run it with the models.xml file and models/resources folder of this repository

## Future work

* Cleanup colors: we use too many, and not consistently ;
* Improve rivers: Lakes should be connected to mountains too. Some rivers won't be connected to mountains because of the shape of their sources, but that might be something to keep ;
* Add small islands around the main landmass ;
* Remove small islands created when a river runs around a lake, or when rivers meet ;
* Ultimatly, try to re-factor the code and remove useless parts.
